Great! Since your GitHub project already includes **interview questions** and **practical examples** for **strings, lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries**, your `README.md` should give a clear overview of what the project covers, its purpose, and how others can benefit from it.

Hereâ€™s a sample `README.md` section for your **"Introduction to Data Structures in Python"** project:

# Introduction to Data Structures in Python

This repository provides a beginner-friendly introduction to core data structures in Python. It is designed to help learners strengthen their understanding of how to work with:

* **Strings**
* **Lists**
* **Tuples**
* **Sets**
* **Dictionaries**

## ðŸ“˜ What's Inside

* âœ… Basic syntax and operations for each data structure
* âœ… Practical coding problems with solutions
* âœ… Common interview questions and answers
* âœ… Real-world scenarios to build hands-on skills

## ðŸ’¡ Who This Is For

This repo is perfect for:

* Beginners learning Python
* Students preparing for coding interviews
* Anyone revisiting Python data structures for practice

## ðŸ§  Topics Covered

* **String Manipulation**: slicing, formatting, searching, replacing
* **List Operations**: indexing, appending, list comprehension
* **Tuple Usage**: immutability, unpacking, use cases
* **Set Applications**: uniqueness, set operations (union, intersection)
* **Dictionary Workflows**: key-value access, nested dictionaries, iteration

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Clone the repo

   ```bash
